# Timetable-Optimisation-and-Visualisation
This project analyses my weekly timetable to reduce commute time and reassign that time to study. Using Python and pandas, I optimise and compare schedules, then visualise changes with matplotlib. The aim is to show how data-driven tweaks improve productivity and time management effectively.
